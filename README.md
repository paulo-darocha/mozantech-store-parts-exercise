## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
This will create the node-modules folder and the application is ready to start.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

if you need to change the "http://localhost:3000" address to something else, access the <h6>useService hook function</h6> and change the <h6>url variable</h6>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
